## Research Overview

This research investigates how effectively BERT embedding models can capture and represent the organization of medical knowledge as defined by human experts. We use the AnKing flashcard dataset with its expert-curated tagging system as our gold standard for medical knowledge organization.

## Key Research Questions

1. How well do fine-tuned embedding models align with expert-created medical knowledge structures?
2. What impact do data enhancement techniques (LLM-based acronym expansion, readability improvements) have on alignment with expert tags?
3. Which embedding approaches best capture hierarchical medical knowledge organization?
4. How does performance vary across different medical domains and tag hierarchies?

## Methodology

### Models Evaluated
- **BERT Raw** - Base BERT fine-tuned on original medical textbooks
- **BERT Enhanced** - Base BERT fine-tuned on LLM-enhanced medical textbooks

*Note: Focus on BERT variants to establish baseline performance and evaluate data enhancement impact.*

### Datasets
- **Training Data**: Medical textbooks (raw and LLM-enhanced)
- **Evaluation Data**: AnKing flashcard deck with expert-curated tags
- **Enhancement**: LLM-based acronym expansion and readability improvements

### Evaluation Framework
- Tag prediction accuracy
- Centroid aggregation analysis  
- Hierarchical evaluation metrics
- Cross-domain performance analysis
